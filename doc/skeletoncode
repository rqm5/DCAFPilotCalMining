Declarations of some functions in Python:

* Parsing CMS calendar database dump

def parse_schema(fschema):
    """parse a schema file for the type of each field
    input: a schema file
    output: an ordered dictionary of each schema attribute and its type

def parse_dataframe_by_match_record(fdataframe, attribute2type):
    """  parse dataframe, by specifying each record and reach field
    input: a dataframe file, and an ordered dict of each schema attribute and its type
    output: a list of dicts, each of which is the parsed result of each conference by the schema
    allow PRES_TITLE field span more than one lines, and assume other fields can't span more than one line

* Data analysis

def count_conf(conf_db)
    """ extract conference counts in time slots (weeks) from calendar database
    input: conference data in some database
    output: a list (or dictionary) of pairs, each pair is (week_str, ct_int), where ct_int is the number of conferences (or even talks) in the week specified by string week_str.

def build_model(conf_ct, data_access)
    """build a statistical model between conference count per time slot and dataset accesses per time slot
    input:
    conf_ct is the output of count_conf
    data_access is a dataframe containing information about physicists accessing the datasets.
    output:
    a statistical model modeling their relations

    """ predict dataset accesses from conference count in the future time slot, using a model
    input:
    model is a model  built by build_model().
    conf_ct is the conference count in the future time slot
